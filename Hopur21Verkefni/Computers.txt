The difference engine - Charles Babbage - Joseph Clement - began in 1822, never completed - He and Babbage fell out over costs around 1831.
Mechanical calculator
His design was finally constructed in 1989–1991, 
using his plans and 19th century manufacturing tolerances. It performed its first calculation at the Science Museum, London, 
returning results to 31 digits.

Analytical Engine. - C. G. Jarvis - Charles Babbage - Ada Lovelace -  Mechanical computer
Analytical Engine - first described in 1837. Babbage was never able to complete construction of any of his machines due to 
conflicts with his chief engineer and inadequate funding. 
The work on the design of the Analytical Engine started in 1835.
In 1991, the London Science Museum built a complete and working specimen of Babbage's Difference Engine No. 2

Pascaline - Blaise Pascal started 1642. He built twenty of these machines (called Pascal's calculator or Pascaline) in the following ten years - Mechanical calculator

The Thomas Arithmometer -  Charles Xavier Thomas de Colmar - 1820 - Mechanical calculator

Drift Sight - developed by Harry Wimperis in 1916 - mechanical device

Z1 - Konrad Zuse - designed by Konrad Zuse from 1935 to 1936 and built by him from 1936 to 1938 -
binary electrically driven mechanical calculator with limited programmability, reading instructions from punched celluloid film.

Z2 - Konrad Zuse - created in 1939 - electromechanical relay computer

Z3 - Konrad Zuse - 1941 - electromechanical programmable, fully automatic digital computer

Atanasoff–Berry Computer (ABC) in 1942 -  John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford E. Berry of Iowa State University -  
first electronic digital calculating device. was never built, did not really work

Colossus - Tommy Flowers - Sidney Broadhurst - William Chandler - from early February 1943 designing and building the first Colossus - finished 1945 -  
world's first electronic digital programmable computer - Special-purpose electronic digital programmable computer

Colossus Mark 2 - 1944 - Tommy Flowers - Sidney Broadhurst - William Chandler - Allen Coombs

ENIAC - first electronic programmable computer built in the US - Turing-complete - John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert
ENIAC's development and construction lasted from 1943 to full operation at the end of 1945

Enigma - electro-mechanical rotor cipher machines - Arthur Scherbius - 1918

Manchester "baby" - stored-program computer -  Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill - ran its first program on 21 June 1948
